Version Control Systems
1 Question: What is Git, and how is it used in DevOps? 
Answer: Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously and helps manage code versions.
2. Question: Explain the concept of branching and merging in Git.
Answer: Branching allows developers to create a separate copy of the codebase to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Merging is the process of integrating changes from different branches back into the main branch.
3. Question: What is a pull request? 
Answer: A pull request is a method of submitting contributions to a project. It allows developers to notify team members that they have completed a feature or bug fix and request that their changes be reviewed and merged into the main branch.
4. Question: How do you handle conflicts in Git? 
Answer: Conflicts in Git occur when changes from different branches clash. To resolve conflicts, you need to manually edit the conflicted files, 
marking the changes to keep and removing the conflicting markers, and then commit the resolved changes.
5. Question: What is a Git repository? 
Answer: A Git repository is a storage location for the project's code and its version history.
It contains all the files and directories for the project, as well as metadata about the projectâ€™s revisions.
